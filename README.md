postage
=======

Script to figure out the number and denomination of stamps to use for any
given amount of postage.

I work for the U.S. Postal Service, and customers sometimes prefer using stamps
on packages instead of the computer-printed label. This program will calculate
the number and denominations of stamps to use. Eventually, I would like to
optimize it so it will give preference to using multiples of the same
denomination, rather than using a top-down approach. In other words, if
someone wants $0.98, the program would offer using two 49 cent stamps, rather
than 91, 5 and 2 cent stamps.

The program should also take into account changing rates, so the stamp
database would need to be dynamic.

Future improvements may include calculating postage rates based on zip code
and weight, and providing the needed stamps for that package.

I am very new with Python, so any suggestions for improvements are greatly
welcome. Email me at slappadebeyass@gmail.com.
